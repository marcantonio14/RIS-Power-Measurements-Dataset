# RIS-Power-Measurements-Dataset
***
#### Here we provide the dataset containing the power measurements carried out in the anechoic chamber of TU Darmstadt. 
The test was performed under the following conditions:
* TX at 1m away from RIS with -3°
* RX at 6m away from RIS with -33°
* Horn antennas gain = 13.5 dBi 
* OFDM QPSK-modulated symbols with 5 MHz of bandwidth, numerology that meets LTE requirements. 
* TX power per subcarrier = -30 dBm
* Reference signal received power (RSRP) sampling at RX
* Noise floor = -90dBm

In the CSV file, the pair (θ<sub>n</sub>, Φ<sub>n</sub>) defines the RIS main beam location: θ<sub>n</sub> for the azimuth and Φ<sub>n</sub> for the elevation.
Instead, θ<sub>r</sub> indicates the angle for the radiation pattern varying with a step of 3° on the azimuth.
